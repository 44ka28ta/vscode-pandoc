[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension lets you easily render markdown files as a `pdf`, `word document` or `html` file.

You need to [install Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) - a universal document converter.

Two ways to run the extension. You need to have a markdown file open.

1. press `F1` on Windows (cmd+P on Mac), type `pandoc`, press `Enter`
2. Or - press the key chord `ctrl+k` then `p`
 
Then choose from the list what document type you want to render and press `enter` (you can also type in the box rather than cursor around).
